	Support row and column highlighting, and provide an example implementation of a menubar
	system which uses this. There's also a half-finished example showing a dialog box, doesn't
	look great though.

	Currently depends on perl-5.10 (for/when), should be easy to drop this if there's any
	demand for pre-5.10 support.
